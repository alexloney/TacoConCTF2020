# Hidden Tacos

```
Lesson 7: Computers like to protect users from themselves by making it hard to find or change certain files. However, these files often contain useful or sensitive configuration information that can be useful for our work.

This zip file appears to be empty... but maybe it holds hidden treasures... hidden tacos...

I'm not sure what the challenge was here? The ZIP file had a lot of "hidden" files in it (hidden in therms of Linux, beginning with a period).
