# Zombie Taco

```
Holy Cow! There's been an outbreak! Tacos are raising from the dead! I found proof on this computer!

Now if I can just figure out where it is on this computer.... I hope I didn't delete it...
```

Looking at this file, it's a memory dump and has various files/programs that were open in memory at the time. I got a hint by noticing "Where is that jpeg?? I must have deleted it!" in the file.

From there, I looked for "JFIF" and located the JPG file in memory. Copied the JPEG file out into a new file and was able to open/view the key.
